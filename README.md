# Tuning studio
Creating a free alternative for reading and editing common files used in the automotive industry for ECU tuning.
It will be a port in C#/WPF and a merge of several small programs already developed individually.

Further details will come soon !

Until now, the parser for Intel Hex and Motorola S-record has been implemented.
I am currently porting the A2L file parser.
